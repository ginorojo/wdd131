<h1>Hungry appe</h1>
<p>
  I chose this name because it's the name of my sister's restaurant, and since
  she doesn't have an informative website for her business, I decided to create
  a website for her restaurant. The name "Appe" is a cryptocurrency Appe coin,
  and my brother-in-law has an NFT of that coin which he uses as the brand logo.
</p>

<h2>Site purpose</h2>
<p>
  Hungry appe is a real restaurant which belongs to my sister, this restaurant
  offers different varieties of lunch at a very affordable price and with an
  amazing quality, in addition to fast food. All this with Peruvian seasoning.
